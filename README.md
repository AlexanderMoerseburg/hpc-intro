# Practical introduction to High Performance Computing (HPC)

Course Materials repository. 

This repository is compiled using the `{rmarkdown}` R package:

```r
rmarkdown::render_site()
```

The _html_ files are in the `docs` folder, from which the GitHub pages are built. 


## Notes

Need to check whether this works and is useful for images/references/etc:

- https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-link_attributes


## TODO

- Create a folder with files for exercises (which is also used for the file transfer lesson)

- Lesson 2:
  - Update screenshots with the setup used for the training; Figure 2 missing snapshots after logged in
  - Exercise 2 needs completing
    - change python exercise to redirect to file instead (this allows us easily appending)

- Lesson 3:
  - Include environment variables somewhere
  - include interactive access to compute nodes (`sintr`)

- Extras for another iteration of the course:
  - GNU parallel
